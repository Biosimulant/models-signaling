# Almeida2019 - Transcription-based circadian mechanism controls the duration of molecular clock states in response to signaling inputs

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000839)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Sofia Almeida; Madalena Chaves; Franck Delaunay

## Description

This is a transcriptional-based mathematical model centered on linear combinations of the clock controlled elements (CCEs): E-box, R-box and D-box, used to identify the essential interactions needed t


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
