# models-signaling

Curated collection of **cell signaling** and **signal transduction** simulation models for the **biosim** platform. This repository contains 372 computational models of signaling pathways, receptor dynamics, second messengers, and signal transduction cascades.

## What's Inside

### Models (372 packages)

**Cell Signaling** — signal transduction pathways, receptor activation, and signaling networks:

**Key Areas:** MAPK/ERK pathways, PI3K/AKT signaling, calcium signaling, cAMP/PKA pathways, JAK/STAT, Wnt, Notch, TGF-β, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and crosstalk between signaling networks.

All models use SBML format with tellurium runtime.

## Prerequisites
```bash
pip install "biosim @ git+https://github.com/BioSimulant/biosim.git@main"
```
