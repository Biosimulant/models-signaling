**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: J M González-Miranda

## Description

This is a mathematical model for NF-κB oscillations, described by a set of ordinary nonlinear differential equations, when perturbed by a circadian oscillation.


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
