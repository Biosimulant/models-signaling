# Mathematical Modeling of Ligand Competition at the Cell–Extracellular Matrix Interface

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2211300001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Zeynep Karagöz; Geuens T; LaPointe VLS; van Griensven M; Carlier A

## Description

Modeling the competition of two ligands which have the ability to bind to the same receptor. Example is given from ECM proteins fibronectin and von Willebrand factor and their common receptor integrin


## Usage
