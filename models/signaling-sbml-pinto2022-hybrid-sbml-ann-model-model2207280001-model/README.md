# Pinto2022 - Hybrid SBML/ANN model

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2207280001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: biomodels_ebi

## Description

This model picks up an already published mechanistic model by Chassagnole et al. (2001) for the threonine synthesis pathway model of E. coli and turns it into a hybrid model with a deep neural network


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/signaling-sbml-pinto2022-hybrid-sbml-ann-model-model2207280001-model/model.yaml
