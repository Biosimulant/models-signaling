**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Sriram M Ajay; Upinder S Bhalla

## Description

This is a model of ERKII signaling which is bistable due to feedback. The feedback occurs through ERKII phosphorylation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), leading to increased production of arachidonic acid 


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/signaling-sbml-ajay-bhalla-2007-bistable-model9147091146-model/model.yaml
