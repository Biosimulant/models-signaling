# Dasgupta2020 - Reduced model of receptor clusturing and aggregation

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000973)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Andrei K Garzon Dasgupta; Alexey A Martyanov; Aleksandra A Filkova; Mikhail A Panteleev; Anastasia N Sveshnikova

## Description

a simple kinetic mass-action-law-based model could be utilized to adequately describe clustering inresponse to activation both in 2D and in 3D


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/signaling-sbml-dasgupta2020-reduced-model-of-receptor-clusturin-biomd0000000973-model/model.yaml
```
