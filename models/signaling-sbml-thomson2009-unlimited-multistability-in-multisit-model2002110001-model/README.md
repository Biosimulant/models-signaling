# Thomson2009 – Unlimited multistability in multisite phosphorylation systems

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2002110001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Matthew Thomson; Jeremy Gunawardena

## Description

This model describes a distributive, sequential system with n = 4, which is a simplified example of unlimited multistability in multisite phosphorylation systems. This method can be applied to systems


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/signaling-sbml-thomson2009-unlimited-multistability-in-multisit-model2002110001-model/model.yaml
