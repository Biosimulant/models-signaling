# Mulberry2020 - Two-layered, self-organizing multicellular structure where all cells are of the same genotype

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2009210001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Nicola Mulberry; Leah Edelstein-Keshet

## Description

This model generates a two-layered, multicellular structure from a simple cell-cell signaling model. The cell signaling model is described by a system of ordinary differential equations, and is couple


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/signaling-sbml-mulberry2020-two-layered-self-organizing-multice-model2009210001-model/model.yaml
