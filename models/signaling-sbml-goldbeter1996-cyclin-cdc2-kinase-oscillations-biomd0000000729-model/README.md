# Goldbeter1996 - Cyclin Cdc2 kinase Oscillations

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000729)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: A Goldbeter; J M Guilmot

## Description

We consider a minimal cascade model previously proposed for the mitotic oscillator driving the embryonic cell division cycle. The model is based on a bicyclic phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascade


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/signaling-sbml-goldbeter1996-cyclin-cdc2-kinase-oscillations-biomd0000000729-model/model.yaml
