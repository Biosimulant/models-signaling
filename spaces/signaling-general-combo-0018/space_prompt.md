# Space Prompt - signaling-general-combo-0018

Create a scientifically coherent **signaling / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: signaling-sbml-chen2009-erbb-signaling-biomd0000000255-model, signaling-sbml-chulian2021-feedback-signalling-in-b-lymphopoeis-biomd0000001056-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
