# Space Prompt - signaling-general-combo-0015

Create a scientifically coherent **signaling / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: signaling-sbml-cao2013-application-of-absis-in-the-the-enzymati-biomd0000000487-model, signaling-sbml-capuani2015-binding-of-cbl-and-gbr2-to-egfr-mult-biomd0000000594-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
