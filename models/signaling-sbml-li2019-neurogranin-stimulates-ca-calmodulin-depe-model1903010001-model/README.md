# Li2019 - Neurogranin stimulates Ca/calmodulin-dependent kinase II by inhibiting Calcineurin

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1903010001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Lu Li; Massimo Lai; Stephen Cole; Nicolas Le Novère; Stuart J. Edelstein

## Description

Calmodulin sits at the center of molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Its complex, and sometimes opposite, influences via the binding to various proteins are yet to be fully understood


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
