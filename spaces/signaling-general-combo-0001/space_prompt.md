# Space Prompt - signaling-general-combo-0001

Create a scientifically coherent **signaling / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: signaling-sbml-a-model-of-yeast-cell-cycle-regulation-based-on-model1812060001-model, signaling-sbml-ahmedmobeen2021-nf-kb-activation-model-model2001290001-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
