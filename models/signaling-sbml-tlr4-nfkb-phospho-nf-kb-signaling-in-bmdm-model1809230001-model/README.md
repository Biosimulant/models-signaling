# TLR4-NFkB-phospho-NF-kB signaling in BMDM

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1809230001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Alexander V Bagaev; Anastasiya Y Garaeva; Ekaterina S Lebedeva; Alexey V Pichugin; Ravshan I Ataullakhanov

## Description

The model was constructed to describe TLR4 induced NF-κB activation in native bone marrow-derived macrophages. It included processes of ligand (lipopolysaccharide) recognition, formation of dimer rece


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
